# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project uses the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.  
It helps businesses identify **loyal customers, lost customers, and potential loyalists**, improving marketing strategy and customer retention.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 RFM Model Explanation
| Metric | Description | Example |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Recency (R)** | How recently a customer made a purchase | Fewer days = more active |
| **Frequency (F)** | How often they purchase | Higher = more loyal |
| **Monetary (M)** | How much money they spend | Higher = more valuable |

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset  
2. Calculated **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** values per customer  
3. Scored each customer on R, F, and M metrics (1–5 scale)  
4. Combined the scores to form the **RFM Score**  
5. Categorized customers into segments such as:
   - 🏆 Champions  
   - 💎 Loyal Customers  
   - 🌱 Potential Loyalists  
   - 💤 Lost Customers  

---

## 📈 Visualization Example
The notebook includes a bar chart visualizing customer segments:
```
Champions, Loyal Customers, Potential Loyalists, Lost Customers, etc.
```

---

## 💾 Output File
- **RFM_Customer_Segmentation.csv** — contains all customers with their RFM metrics and assigned segment.
